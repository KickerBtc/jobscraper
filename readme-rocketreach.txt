This script uses the RocketReach API's search/email endpoint to search for executives of fintech, blockchain, DeFi, or cryptocurrency businesses on LinkedIn. It then filters the search results to only include executives with more than 1 job opening, and prints the names and emails of these executives to the console.Keep in mind that this script is just a basic example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific needs or to handle errors and pagination. Additionally, the RocketReach API has rate limits that may limit the number of requests you can make in a given time period.
